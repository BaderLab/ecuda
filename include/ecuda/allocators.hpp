/// \brief An STL allocator for page-locked host memory.
///
/// The implementation uses the CUDA API functions cudaMallocHost and
/// cudaFreeHost.
///
/// Page-locked or "pinned" memory makes copying memory from the GPU (device)
/// to the CPU (host) faster.  Using STL containers with this allocator makes
/// them better at acting as "staging" points when moving data from the
/// device memory to the host memory. This is used internally to optimize
/// host <=> device transfers that involve any kind of temporary staging memory,
/// but can be used effectively by an end-user of the library as well.
///
/// For example:
/// \code{.cpp}
/// std::vector< int, host_allocator<int> > v;
/// \endcode
/// This would instantiate a vector whose underlying contents would be stored in
/// page-locked host memory.  Then a call to, for example:
/// \code{.cpp}
/// ecuda::vector<int> deviceVector(1000);
/// // do work on device vector using the GPU...
/// std::vector< int, ecuda::host_allocator<int> > hostVector( 1000 );
/// deviceVector >> hostVector; // copy results from device to host
/// \endcode
/// This would potentially be a faster transfer than one would get using a
/// <tt>std::vector</tt> with the default STL allocator.
