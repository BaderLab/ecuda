/// \brief A smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an object in device memory.
///
/// ecuda::shared_ptr is a smart pointer that retains shared ownership of an object in device memory
/// through a pointer. Several shared_ptr objects may own the same object. The object is destroyed
/// and its memory deallocated when either of the following happens:
///
/// - the last remaining shared_ptr owning the object is destroyed
/// - the last remaining shared_ptr owning the object is assigned another pointer via operator= or reset().
///
/// The object is destroyed using ecuda::default_delete or a custom deleter that is supplied to shared_ptr
/// during construction.
///
/// A shared_ptr can share ownership of an object while storing a pointer to another object. This feature
/// can be used to point to member objects while owning the object they belong to. The stored pointer is the
/// one accessed by get(), the dereference and the comparison operators. The managed poitner is the one
/// passed to the deleter when use count reaches zero.
///
/// A shared_ptr may also own no objects, in which case it is called empty (an empty shared_ptr may have
/// a non-null stored pointer if the aliasing constructor was used to create it).
///
/// All specializations of shared_ptr meet the requirements of CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable, and
/// LessThanComparable and are contextually convertible to bool.
///
/// All member functions (including copy constructor and copy assignment) can be called by multiple threads
/// on different instances of shared_ptr without additional synchronization even if these instances are
/// copies and share ownership of the same object. If multiple threads of execution access the same shared_ptr
/// without synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function of shared_ptr then a
/// data race will occur; the shared_ptr overloads of atomic functions can be used to prevent the data race.
